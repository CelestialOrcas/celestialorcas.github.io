What a world of difference one day makes...  
Savannah Brown (great poet btw) released a very raw and emotional song today and yea, im not ok (ill scatter parts from it in here). I don't think I've spent the past 2 and a half months moving like I thought, that phone call wasn't the final piece of the puzzle to rebuild me, to finally let me move on, it wasn't the last string holding me down so that when cut I could drift off into the sky, boundless. It was the first one, and it hurt to cut.  

<h3 style="color:DarkCyan; font-weight:bold;">"I’ll just keep waiting for you, for you, a strange and sacred thing to do"</h3>

I thought that all this time I had been distancing and moving on, but I wasn't. I was just waiting.  
I'm not entirely sure what for other than just to talk, but while we weren't talking at all I could wait until we did, I didn't need to move on because I didn't know if I had to yet, so instead I just waited, pushed everything down until I knew. I didn't even realise I was doing it.  
But then I phoned and was hit with the brick wall of reality in my face that there's nothing left there and either he was lying, or he'd barely thought about me since. The private life of someone once so close had receeded and when the backwash pulled away all that was left underneath was a raw and festering wound. The false plaster of delusion faded and I can now begin to see what is lost.  

<h3 style="color:DarkCyan; font-weight:bold;">"Impossible memory of some future day. It’s summer, your hand’s on my ribs and you say finally! Then you glint and disappear"</h3>

Now I finally have to move on I have to process all thats gone, most of it being the potential futures, days never to pass, and that's when it started to *hurt*.  
I listened to Savannah's song again, internalised the lyrics, the emotions, the pure human feelings behind it, and it all just crashed around me. I burst into tears and didn't stop till my head hurt.  
This has affected me a lot more than I realised and way more than I ever want to admit to someone properly, for some reason even though it didn't last as long, I'm finding myself more affected by this than the ending of the relationship before, and I think thats healthy in a way.  
At the end of the previous one, I didn't cry, I didn't do much of anything. Just fell into a depression that swallowed everything I was and didn't want to let me go, but now, now I'm doing this weird thing called processing, and it hurts but it's good I know it's good, I just need to see it through  

<h3 style="color:DarkCyan; font-weight:bold;">"god, I love waiting for you, for you, this sweet ordeal that I choose"</h3>

Now my safety blanket of ignorance has been ripped away from me by that phone call, and now that song pushed me over the edge of understanding I think I really will begin to move on. I mean I have to, what else is there? At this point despite how much I loved it, it would be unhealthy to wait anymore. So yea, that's where I'm at for now. I guess I just see what the future holds. I feel lighter, but with that comes a joint feeling of emptiness.
