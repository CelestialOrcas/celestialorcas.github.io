Hiya! Sky here just leaving a little post about how I'm done with this blog for the forseeable future  
Was really helpful for me while I needed it, a place for me to make sense of things and work through my issues in a way that made them seem more real than just classic rumination-

Uhhh yea thats basically it? Doing a lot better than I was when I started this earlier this year. Yippeee!

So yea this is Sky, Signing off o/
Mahogany Tables!
