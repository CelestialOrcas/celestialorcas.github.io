Short one to just talk a little bit about D20 Fantasy High, Junior Year

Truely what an amazing campaign all of Fantasy High was. I just recently started watching Dimension 20 and I began with Fantasu High, and then burned through all of Sophomore and Junior year, and wow.  
It has inspired me as a GM so so much to create a world and a story that I'm beginning to be so proud of, with so much planned out and going on in the background, long con slotting into play. While also keeping myself in check to know that all the people at Dimension 20 are experts at this and that I should not at all feel bad that my storytelling may never be objectively as good as brennans, or being online my battle sets and models may never be as impressive as Rick Perry's, and that is fine.  
All that matters is that I'm proud of the story I craft, and the moments I share with my friends are enjoyed by all of us. Love ya T'tag gang <3

But yea! Tomorrow I'm gonna watch the recently released, first episode of the brand new D20 campaign: Cloudward 'Ho!  
It looks SO good, and it'll be my first time seeing the Intrepid Heroes be characters other than the ~~PhotosyntheKids~~ Bad Kids

Thats all from me o/
