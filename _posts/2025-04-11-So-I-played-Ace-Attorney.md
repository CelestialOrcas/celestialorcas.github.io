# These games are nuts!

After years of seeing this franchise get talked about, along with Danganronpa, I thought it was time to give it a go. I'm surprisingly a big fan of legal drama and media as a whole, despite my aggrivations at the legal system. The most recent example I can think of was my shock upon realising during my first watch of the TV Show 'Suits', that I was really really enjoying it, seeing how the cases are built and argued in court, or settled out of court, really captivated me, so going in I was pretty sure I'd enjoy it.
I hit up my friend Monty to ask if there was a specific one I should start with in case it wasnt just a 'start at #1' kind of series, and based on his excitement and assurances, I got the phoenix wright trilogy.

And...wow
I'm only two chapters in (just finished chapter 2 of the first game) and I'm alreading LOVING it! Knowing the truth right at the start was something I thought would put me off, but then I realised, thats kind of how cases are built no? You assume you know the truth and see if you can prove that, and thats the gameplay loop, visiting different places related to the case, talking to people and collecting evidence to then bring up in court while you find the holes in witnesses testimonies. It's really really great!
Only critique so far is how if you dont find the correct thing to push on, or object to at the right moment, then it just loops you. Like there were times where I'd push or object something because I'd worked out what was wrong, and what evidence would prove it, but because it wasn't what the game wanted me to do in that moment, it was deemed unrelated to the case, not exactly sure how thatd be fixed, but it is only the first game so we shall see!

Overall though, really really enjoying it and will continue to post about it as I continue \o/
