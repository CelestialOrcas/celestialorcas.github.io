# The Sequel no one asked for, but we loved

The idea of a sequel to midnight has been something I feared for a while. I always said that it didn't need one and should be left alone, going back to the entity would only reveal more about it and ruin the mystery. I compared this to the weeping angels and how the more we saw them, the more we learnt (and the more they just changed about how they work) and I just didn't wanna see this happen to the midnight entity.  
But wow...they did the impossible, midnight sequel without ruining the original

The moment we step into the base it's clear this is a darker, creepy episode. I was so down for this cause while I've loved the last two episodes being wacky and wild, I was itching for a bit of dark, and oh boy we got it!  
Immediately just bodies everywhere (and the classic Doctor Who space suit helmet orginally from The Impossible Planet, love to see that, just need him to wear it now)  

The first glance at the creature was really well done, proper made me jump as it appears for a second and vanishes. Which is a consistant thing I loved in this episode, the fact we still never *really* see it. Everytime it's on screen it either moves too fast to catch properly, or the one time it moves slowly when The Doctor is set on needing to know what it looks like (after thousands of years for him, and hundreds of thousands for the creature I just love that The Doctor is still set on this thing, he *needs* to know), that one time its not even centre screen, just off in the corner choosing to move slowly as if taunting him... woaiw

But is it actually the midnight entity?  
I know it's been 400,000 years and it could have evolved and changed in that time, but it acts SO different. It doesnt go into bodies, mirror, do anything like that. No it hides behind and waits, whispering into your ear. Not to mention the fact that I'm convinced there's at least 2 of them!  
Obiously theres the one at the end of the episode thats been found to have escaped the planet on Mo's back, the assumption there is that it actually jumped from Belinda to Mo, and Shaya just assumed it jumped to her based on the "rule" they found for it. Very possible it just didn't stick to the rule, why would it?  
But also, earlier in the scene near the end, when Aliss and *two* other people get in the airlock, the camera pans over to show theres *four* life signs in the airlock, the creature is in there with them, but moments later we know its on Belinda, so yea *at least* two of them, maybe more if it did go onto Shaya and there was just another on Mo.  
So yea could be not the same creature, but based on an interview with RTD, he's convinced it is so who knows. I at least think it's potentially not.  

But yea! thats The Well, truly amazing episode, I think the best of the new era, so tense all the way through, and the reveal was top notch. Sat straight up in my chair when they said Xtonic-

What did you all think?! lmk!
