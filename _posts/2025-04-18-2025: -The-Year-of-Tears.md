I think I've cried more in the past 4 months, than in the past 3 years, and it says a lot to my previous emotional state that I've only cried about 7 times in the past 4 months-

Its quite new for me, I'm thanking the HRT (for anyone new I'm transfem and on Estradiol) for it partially, but also I think I'm just allowing myself to open up to my emotions.  
Its refreshing to be able to feel sad, or even just physically express emotions. Before I wouldn't really be able to feel or internalise them, I just felt a perpetual depression, less sad and more white noise, and could feel everything building up so much that I was just awaiting an inevitable mental breakdown, but lately I've been feeling a lot lighter and I think its because I've been able to let these emotions out as they come in and releive the pressure build up.  
I imagine theres still a lot of backlog I need to work through (I guess maybe therapy would be a good idea when I get time and the money) but for now, this is more sustainable.  

Finding myself crying at stuff I didn't expect is interesting too, like it's' not just major events, it's sad episodes of TV!! (Wild that this basic human thing has impacted me so much that I'm writing a post about how happy I am to do it but whatever, peace and love-).

Good breakdown of whats made me cry this year:  
- Being overstimulated in a Five Guys while getting ready to go home after visting my now Ex
- Getting home and missing said Ex
- Him becoming my Ex
- Listening to Savannah Browns omnichord song and wondering why it hit so much
- Listening to it again the next day and realising why it was hitting and what that meant for me
- Black Mirror S07 E05, Eulogy
- Remembering my Grandad  

I'm so full of emotions and so happy about it, for a while I thought I wouldn't unlock this ability and that I was fundementally broken, but it just took time like all things.
