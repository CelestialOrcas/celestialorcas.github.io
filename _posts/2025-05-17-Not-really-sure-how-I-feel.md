Yea, just things feel weird lately
This one is pretty unfiltered so I've not focused super hard on making it well written or flow, but who care this is my blog

I really feel like I want a romantic relationship, god I love them so much and that closeness for me is unmatched but...I don't know it's just kinda hard.  
There's people sure, or well at the moment a person but thats.....a pretty complex situation and I don't think anythings gonna happen there.  
I think the main problem is that I just don't ever know how to meet people, it sounds strange to say since I know...one, two, three...uhhh yea a proper whole bunch o' peeps, and yet maybe my standards are well fucking out there but few people harmonise with me.  
There's a very specific kind of...yea I'll just say it- A specific kind of autism that seems to pull me in ahaha- Listen I'm autistic myself and I just find it's a lot more likely that I'll really bounce off another autistic person well, and so far in my relationships that's been very consistent and true. Just someone whose brain works the same way mine does...oddly that being.  

Though I think it comes back to a larger issue I have where I seem to be a strange ghost in friendships.  
To me, everyone has people they're matched up with (not specifically romantically ofc we're just talking people here) and I...don't?  
Of course everyone has people who they're friends with but in a way where they're just hovering on the outskirts, someone you see every so often, have a good time with but don't closely watch or keep close.  
But alas to me I'm that for everyone? Could be a major personality or otherwise specified failing on my part that I need to work through, I mean that's more likely that "everyone else is weird and wrong"-  

It's night now, 22:34 at this very moment and I'm looking past my computer monitor,  
The room I'm in is dark and still,  
and for a few moments I am certain that I could stand out of my chair,  
walk into the silence that fills my living room,  
and be swallowed whole, peacefully and kindly,  
and only after weeks of absence would anyone come to look,  
by then the room would be empty, it would be still, and yet it would remain kind.  

So yea, emotions are fun-
