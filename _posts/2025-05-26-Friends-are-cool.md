So recently I've had a few instances where I've convinced myself I'm romantically interested in someone (tale as old as time for me, ahopeless romantic)  
BUT then after pondering my orb, have concluded 'Ah! No!' and then just...been their friend.  

Ok ok ok shushsuushsushsusush, yes that is a very standard human interaction but you gotta understand I've been emotionally unavaliable for a long time so these deep interpersonal relationships are new for me, especially ones that are close but platonic?
Usually if I really get on with someone and feel close with them I develop feelings, but like 3 times now I've found that no! platonic and just very cool people I wanna hang out with a lot...  
This sounds sad af in a lame way, I'm now realising across my life a good amount of friendships havent been strictly close...huh  

Anyway!! yea thats cool, someone recently said I wasn't emotionally open which kinda shook me up cause I'd convinced myself that I was super mentally healthy nowadays but nah she was dead on, I'm like always in bit mode nowadays so thats probably a concern.  
Can't wait till I have time and money for therapy!  

Right, toodleoo then!
