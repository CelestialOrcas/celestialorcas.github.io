# Spoiler warning for the whole episode

That was ridiculous-

I mean that in the best way of course, it was quite silly and meta and fun!  
Lot of references back to older series, more than the obvious fourth wall break scene there were tons of music tracks from older episodes, mainly noticed ones from Moffat's Amy and Rory era which was lovely to hear, those tracks are so full of emotion from across the years so they hit really well.

## The TV show theory ---
So in this episode we got a little glimpse at what it would be like the the somewhat populat TV show theory comes true.  
To quickly explain, the theory goes that in this, or the next series (just a future one) the main arc will be a lot of fourth wall breaks, until the Doctor finds out he is in a TV show.  
Now this sounds fun at first, until you think about the future afterward. Now I love 4th wall breaks, all the Mrs Flood (ill get to her from this episode-) scenes, the whole of The Devil's Chord, its all really fun, but I really don't like this theory-  
My issue with it comes with the thought of...then what?  

So lets run with it, its Series 1X finale and The Doctor just found out he was in a TV show, he then uses TV show logic to win and save the day...but then he just knows now, like where do they go with that, does he forget? Thats a bit cheap icl, do they just not mention it again? That'd suck, or do they play into it for the rest of the shows run? That seems like it'd get boring and be unsustainable. To me it just doesnt seem like it has the longevity of the show in mind.  
But! maybe I'm wrong, do let me know in the comments if there's a way it could work afterwards that would be satisfying and a good story  
For now I like how they did it in this episode, one scene (or two after the credits one) where we play it out, The Doctor has a fun moment, we get some jabs at the people stuck in the past (Like guys blink is a good episode but come on its a little overrated (now World Enough and Time however....)), see the people who get excited about the show in the ways we all do as fans, and then they set things right and move on. Very cool scene!!

## The Pantheon ---
Oooooooh Boy! Theyre still around  
Really glad that we're still going with this pantheon. My main hope is that it leads to The Trickster getting an appearance in the main show, my favourite villain from this universe, but we shall see...  
Lux was really cool, and the daylight was a cool way to defeat him, he got so much of what he wanted that he grew too thin.  
Really reminded me of Tooth and Claw, a creature made of moonlight, that they use an abundance of light to defeat, only they used moonlight to kill the wolf in that. Even a line is near identical, to the point where I said the tooth and claw version in sync with The Doctor cause it seemed so familiar to me.  

### Tooth and Claw
Rose: But the wolf needs moonlight, it's made by moonlight  
The Doctor: You're 70% water and you can still drown!  

### Lux
Belinda: But... he was made of light  
The Doctor: We're 60% water and we can still drown.  

Both written by RTD, cool detail!  

Lux himself I really liked, what a fun villain, and the pantheon god reveal itself with the laugh! UGH AMAZING!  

## Final unsorted thoughts ---

I do wish that Belinda didn't jump on board so quickly, I had hoped that she would remain a bit distant and be slowly won after by the end of the series, rather than being in awe of The Doctor by episode 2 but...whatever-  
I like the way the series is set up, in that they're using the 'Vindicator' to reel them in slowly, with stops along the way to triangulate. Could mean we're likely to see every stop and adventure on the way if theyre kind of rushing back, so she may not travel with him for long at all!  

Mrs Flood! With her being in both episodes now it feel like this is her series, was hoping she would be a longer lasting character, and maybe she will be, bu its looking like shes this series. Still not 100% a villain, just quite ominious and creepy.  
Maybe she isnt the villain, but the harbinger, The Doctor said it this episode, the gods of chaos have Harbingers (which btw the fucking letters changing to Harbinger again, its so stupid everytime but I love it so so much-) maybe she's to the main bad of this series what Susan Triad was to Sutekh.  
Kinda hope *not* because she seems more independent, and her just being the doorway to someone else after all this time would be...ehhhh  

Anyway those are my unfiltered thoughts right after the episode! What did everyone else think?!  
Till next week o/
