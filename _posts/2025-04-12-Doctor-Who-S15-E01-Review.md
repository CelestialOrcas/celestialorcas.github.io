The newest episode of Doctor Who dropped yesterday (April 12th 2025) and it's a pretty good one! For all intents and purposes it did an amazing job at starting the new series off right, new companion is brought in and she's a fully fledged person right off the bat, theyre given a reason to travel, and the series arc is set-up, so what stood out to me? (oh btw im probably gonna jump around thoughts a lot)

# Spoiler Warning for the whole episode

### General Premise
I really like the general idea for the episode, the little act of naming a star which never really means anything and is just usually a nice gesture, actually having such a big impact on that star and the planets that orbit it, love that! Having the first episode back in 2025 be this, with the main antagonist being an evil AI generator, controlled by an Incel lunatic was amazing too, very politcally relevant to today, and I'm glad to report that I saw a lot of right wing Incels having a meltdown about it

### Belinda Chandra
Very quickly grew to like her, she's quite strong willed I'd say, like in the middle of....everything where she was surrounded by robots and people whos species were named after her, on a planet orbiting a star also both named after her (already an INSANE situation to be in), they mentioned her getting welded (terrifying so I get it) to a weird computer thing and she's just like "nah I'm good, can I go". LOVE THAT-
Her nursing background is not forgotten instantly at all either, doesnt matter that shes on an alien world and everythings called something else, she very quickly adapts to how things are here and gets to work helping people where she can, setting that guys arm stood out to me as such a small thing that I feel would go overlooked in the context, the guy said it the best "There's people in much worse shape than me" but for that moment he was her patient and she saw a duty of care.
The unwilling companion is always a great trope as well, usually we see it in secondary companions, Rory comes to mind for example, he was (at least at the start) there to keep Amy safe and make sure The Doctor didn't get her killed as he recognised how dangerous The Doctor is, which is something we see in Belinda at the end, she does not want to travel with him, she can tell very quickly he is dangerous to be around and is not enamoured by the charm and the TARDIS (which btw how did she know the name for...that may be something) and the alien skies. She just wants to get home to her life that despite its flaws, she clearly values.

### Sasha-55
Her little part really stuck with me, I think it was great to see the idea of a companion death be shown through someone we never got to know. The Doctor and Sasha clearly grew very close in those 6 months, to the point where from The Doctors perspective, she was the most recent companion but we, the viewer, only saw her send off, her series finale goodbye in episode one.
I think she makes a great contrast to Belinda too, she wanted to go with The Doctor and travel the stars, but didn't get to, whereas Belinda who doesn't want to is current being, basically forced to because he can't get her home, really neat parallel there. Something about how The Doctor saw a companion die who wanted to travel with him, and very quickly latched onto the nearest person to fill that void, but she's having none of it (though he was already looking into Belinda before he met Sasha)

### Polish Polish
Polish Polish!

### Future set-ups
I'm really intruiged by the set-ups for what seem to be this series' over-arching story, we got more Mrs Flood which could very well be this series' big thing (Kind of hope not and she's a longer play, maybe for Ncuti's send off, whenever that is), but the part that DEFINITELY is gonna link to the finale is the last shot, somethings stopping them from getting to May 24th 2025 (the day that part one of the finale  drops), and then as we watch the TARDIS materialise away, the camera pulls back to see wreckages, London cabs, a bit of the Statue of Liberty, either the Eiffel Tower or just a pylon- and then a calender marking the day that this all happens as May 24th 2025, got REAL Stolen Earth vibes from it, and was such a cool thing to do, just in the last few seconds be like "Oh yea also Earth is destroyed anyway roll credits!"
...wow, RTD would make a good D&D GM if he ends sessions like that-

### Final Thoughts and Goodbye

But yea! That was my little review-y post thing! Hope you all enjoyed hearing what I thought of certain bits for some reason-
I'm very excited for the next episode for sure, and am keeping my eye on a lot of thing. Like Belinda's surname being Chandra, no way thats just RTD only using one surname for indian descent characters right? Surely she's linked to Rani Chandra in some way (Not THE RANI for you 'Rani Truthers' out there- Y'all will grasp onto anything, love you lot). Her knowing what the TARDIS was without being told it's name at any point stood out to me. The Shwooping, either that wasn't well explained, I missed the satisfying explantion, or it's a mystery yet to be solved (I think the latter cause I recall The Doctor mentioning that they didn't know how the robots got the certificate from the future, though we see it in the Earth wreckages so its gonna be something), and of course, Mrs Flood, who is this wild woman, cannot tell if she's a villain or not. She's creepy and weird for sure, but has never said anything directly malicious so we will see.

Anyway I'll see you all next week for Episode 2!
