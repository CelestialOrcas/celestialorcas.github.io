# Welcome

Hiya!
I did the bare minimum amount of coding to make a blog site (my brain cannot handle code) and now I have this place!
I will be posting stuff here to do with my life every so often, as one does with a blog-

To anyone who doesnt know me, Hallo! My name is Sky and as of this blog post in April 2025 I'm a 21 year old Psychology student from the UK. I occasionally play some video games, watch some media, do gay and transgender things, and overall just be the coolest person in existance
I dont really know what stuff will go here yet, maybe just like my thoughts and feelings, if i ever write any short stories again i guess they can go here too, oh and also any reviews of things!
Wanted to make something like this for a while, dabbled with a private tumblr account, but I have to give that out to people, and then my new posts just instantly show up on their dash, whereas this is something I can link in my bios and people choose to look at (and they never will! but who care this is for me-)

but yea! hope y'all enjoy this window into my soul
