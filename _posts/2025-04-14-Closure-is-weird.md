On the 23rd of January 2025 I got broken up with, we were together for just over 2 months and it somehow affected me more than the relationship before which last a year and a half. We then didn't talk for 2 and a half months until today, because today.
### I called him

Now I know what you're thinking "Sky wtf, thats like the one thing you're not supposed to do" and yea yea yea I know, theres the whole 'I should call him' joke (usually in sexual contexts but its still highlight as a bad thing so shuhsusuhsu), but it wasn't like that I swear!  
The last time we had spoken was on the day we broke up, I was at weatherspoons getting drunk about it...for the first time (it was actually iconic of me I can't lie, I probably nearly died but....baaaahhh whatever), I called him (this time yes in that way) and it, and I, was a mess.  
Then over the next two and a half months we saw eachother like twice in public, and said nothing. This was unsustainable for me, I couldn't move on fully because I didn't get the closure I thought I needed, so today I called him to talk. I wanted to go over things, and have us both say the stuff we needed to say to put it all to rest, we'd both say our piece maybe ask a few questions and maybe reconnect as friends, or just move on...  
Yea so thats not really how it went at all, it was...confusing

I called him up and explained that I thought it might be a good idea, and he seemed receptive to the idea, ok great start.  
Then I realised I didn't really have anything to say, or ask, I didn't know if I actually needed closure anymore. We talked a little about the break up and my way of dealing with it that night (felt a little patronised when he judged me for my reckless actions that night, but so has everyone else so whatever-), and of course the traditional "how have you been" "yea ive been ok, Uni y'know, you?" "haha yea same Uni...............................................so..."  
The whole interaction was just awkward, I had to fill every silence, which ok maybe it is on me to lead this conversation, I reached out to get closure, but I don't know, I thought he'd have something to say, or ask, but no the only questions he had were one about returning a present I gave him just before (which good, I did want that back tbh) and something about the god damn Switch 2 direct...*what?*  

The whole situation felt very distant and a bit odd, I started to doubt the whole relationship, like it seems great and pretty health, we break up (and I understand the reasons and honestly support them), then two months of radio silence and nothing to say, we became...kind of nothing so quickly, so were we really anything to begin with?  
Then I very quickly stopped that thought process, because at least at the moment... I don't care? Thats the closure, I got it and I genuinely think I'm fine now. I'm confused by it yea, but in terms of moving on I think I can, and already have because I don't feel too upset by this weird and awkward encounter. It's more like a "huh, thats interesting...anyway" than anything else, so yea... anyway  
Lets see what's next
