# Hiya!

My name is Sky Ford (she/they, if ya nasty)
I'm a 21 year old Psychology student from the UK with a strong love for Doctor Who and Zelda (those being my favourite tv show and game series respectively).
My favourite Zelda game is Wind Waker, but my favourite *game* is Outer Wilds

As previously stated my fav show is Doctor Who with Wild Blue Yonder being my top episode, closly followed by World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls
As a part of my doctor who madness I have collected all but one of the character options sonic screwdrives (that sonic pen haunts my dreams), and have done the <a href= "https://whodle.dixonary.co.uk" >Whodle</a> every day since it started


Ive wanted to make a place like this for a whiiile but never got around to it until now, I originally tried to have a private tumblr, but then my new posts instantly showed up on peoples dashboards, whereas I wanted this to be a place people could check in on when they felt like it. Then I thought id make a neocities website (and i still might one day) but quickly remembered I can't code, like it just doesnt go in, so here we are, a blog make using an existing theme that requires very little coding!

But yea! For now thats me, hope you enjoy all that I write here

-Sky
